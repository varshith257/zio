ZIO provides several data types which are a very coarse way of using concurrency, but they are implemented as if every single word were lockable. So the granularity of concurrency is fine-grained. It increases the performance and concurrency. For example, if we have two fibers accessing the same ",(0,i.yg)("inlineCode",{parentName:"li"},"TArray"),", one of them reads and writes on the first index of our array, and another one reads and writes to the second index of that array, they will not conflict. It is just like as if we were locking the indices, not the whole array.
